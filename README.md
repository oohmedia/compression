# @oohmedia/compression

This is yet another, and hopefully a temporary fork of https://github.com/expressjs/compression

Brotli has been enabled by default, and the compression level defaulted to 4 which is a lot more sensible/faster than Node's default.

Support for ancient Node versions has been dropped.

Some outstanding PRs from express have also been merged.
